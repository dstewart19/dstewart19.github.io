Welcome to my website! It is currently under development but will continue to be updated regularly. There are many goals of this site going forward. 

1. Demonstrate and archive my long term development as a scholar throughout my PhD studies.
2. Produce and maintain easy to interpret resources for peers within the Machine Learning field.
3. Help me have fun sharing my experience with others.
