Beginning in May 2017 I have been working on research funded by the United States Office of Naval Research focusing on semi-supervised learning algorithms to segment sonar imagery of the sea floor. Past work has focused on quantitative comparisons of superpixel segmentation (see publications page). Currently I am focused on applying information statistics to sonar imagery to combine data into meaningful scenes.
